# ML practice

Some simple Machine learning algorithms that I learned over the winter break

Lig Reg: linear regression analysis done on multi-variant data, used to predict final grade of students

KNN: K-nears neighbours, used for classification, predicts the class of a car

SVM: Support vector machines,  used for classification of higher dimension datas, used to detect of a tumor is malignant or benign

K means clustering: Unsupervised ML algorithm used for classification. Tranning data is not classified
